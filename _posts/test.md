Hello! My name is Gustavo Penha, and this is the first post of my blog. I am a computer scientist currently studying at [UFMG][ufmg] who wants to graduate by 2016 :). I am doing this blog as sort of an experiment. I'll post about things such as open-source contributions - which I intend to do this year - and other works from college as well as from scientific initiation that I been doing for about a month.

Moving from myself to another subject, this site is being served by [Jeskyll][jeskyll], which I got to know because of github's trending open-source projects page. I will be completely honest and say that I gave it a try mostly because it's a project written in ruby, and I've been drawed to this programming language since I've got the opportunity to use it.

It was incredibly painless to start my blog using [Jeskyll][jeskyll] and I believe I will keep using it for the near future. I still have to learn more about [Markdown][markdown], which is the way I am styling this text right now. Overall they both seems pretty nice.

What took me the most effort was publishing it in Github pages, I was constantly getting the error below:

>The page build failed with the following error:

>The file `my-site/css/main.scss` contains syntax errors

After some time searching for errors in this file and in github and stackoverflow threads, I realized on this [blog][blogpost] by @egeersoz that my error was using another folder for my blog inside my repository. After moving everything to the root of the repository it started working fine.

To wrap up this post and start this blog I will make a short list of what I expect to be focusing on this blog:

* Computer Science
* Code
* Programming 
* Open-source 
* Articles
* Tutorials


I think that's all for my first post guys, cya.
